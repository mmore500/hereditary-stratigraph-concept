\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

In order to assess the practical performance of the hereditary stratigraph approach in an applied setting, we simulated the process of stratigraph propagation over known ``ground truth'' phylogenies extracted from pre-existing digital evolution simulations \citep{hernandez2022phylogenetic}.
Across ground truth phylogenies, we were able to reconstruct the phylogenetic topology with between 47.75\% and 85.70\% of the information contained in the original tree using a 64-bit column memory footprint, between 47.75\% and 80.36\% using a 512-bit column memory footprint, and between 51.13\% and 83.53\% using a 4096-bit column memory footprint.
