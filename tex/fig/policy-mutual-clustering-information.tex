    Comparison of phylogenetic reconstruction quality between stratum retention policies.
    Reconstruction quality measured as mutual clustering information between reconstructed phylogeny and ground truth phylogeny \citep{smith2020information, smith2020treedist}.
    Higher is better.
    RPR is recency-proportional resolution stratum retention policy and TDPR is tapered depth-proportional resolution stratum retention policy.
