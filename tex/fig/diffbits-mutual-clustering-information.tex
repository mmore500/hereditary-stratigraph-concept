  Comparison of phylogenetic reconstruction quality across differentia bit counts.
  Reconstruction quality measured as mutual clustering information between reconstructed phylogeny and ground truth phylogeny \citep{smith2020information, smith2020treedist}.
  Higher is better.
  RPR is recency-proportional resolution stratum retention policy and TDPR is tapered depth-proportional resolution stratum retention policy.
