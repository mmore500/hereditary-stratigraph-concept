\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This and other methodology to enable decentralized observation and analysis of evolving systems will be essential for digital evolution experiments that use distributed and best-effort computing approaches.
Such methods will be crucial to enabling experimental analyses while preserving those systems' efficiency and scalability.
As parallel and distributed computing becomes increasingly ubiquitous and begins to more widely pervade digital evolution systems, hereditary stratigraphy should serve as a useful technique in this toolbox.
